## Additional Repository

Check out my another GitHub repository that implements AES encryption and decryption in Python.

This repository showcases AES encryption and decryption techniques implemented in Python. It offers a comprehensive demonstration of encrypting and decrypting data using the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) algorithm, providing a secure and efficient approach to data protection.

### Features

- **AES Encryption**: Encrypt sensitive data using the AES algorithm for secure storage and transmission.
- **AES Decryption**: Decrypt encrypted data to retrieve the original information securely.
- **Key Management**: Manage encryption keys securely to ensure the confidentiality and integrity of encrypted data.
- **Usage Examples**: Includes usage examples and demonstrations for easy integration into your projects.

### Technologies Used

- **Python**: Programming language used for implementation.
- **AES Algorithm**: Advanced Encryption Standard algorithm for data encryption and decryption.

### Getting Started

To explore and utilize the AES encryption and decryption functionalities, follow the instructions provided in the repository.
